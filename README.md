# UAV_DataSet_NetworkCommunication

UAV Network Communication **Experimental dataset** is a collection of network traffic captured from a wireless network used by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during a simulated search and rescue mission. The dataset includes both legitimate network traffic and traffic generated by WiFi and GPS attacks.

The WiFi attacks in the dataset include various STRIDE attacks, in which the attacker sends forged deauthentication packets to disconnect the legitimate users from the network, and jamming attacks, in which the attacker floods the network with radio signals to disrupt the communication.

The GPS attacks in the dataset include GPS jamming, in which the attacker emits a signal on the same frequency as the GPS signal to disrupt the GPS communication, and GPS spoofing, in which the attacker sends fake GPS signals to mislead the UAVs.

The dataset can be used to evaluate the performance of intrusion detection systems for UAV network communication and to develop countermeasures against WiFi and GPS attacks in UAV networks.
